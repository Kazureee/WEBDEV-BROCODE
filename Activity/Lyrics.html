            [Verse 1]
            I'll be the one that stays 'til the end
            And I'll be the one that needs you again
            And I'll be the one that proposes in a garden of roses
            And truly loves you long after our curtain closes

            [Chorus]
            But will you still love me when nobody wants me around?
            When I turn eighty-one and forget things, will you still be proud?

            [Verse 2]
            'Cause I am the one that's waited this long
            And I am the one that might get it wrong
            And I'll be the one that will love you the way I'm supposed to, girl, oh

            [Chorus]
            But will you still love me when nobody wants me around, around?
            When I turn eighty-one and forget things, will you still be proud?

            [Bridge]
            Proud of me and my short list of accomplishments, say
            And me and my lack of new news
            Me and my selfishness, oh, me and myself
            Wish you nothing but a happy new version of you

            [Outro]
            Because I
            I, mmm
            Mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm, yeah
            I want you to tell me you find it hard to be yourself
            So I can say it's gonna be alright, yeah
            And I want you to love me the way you love your family
            The way you love to show me what it's like
            To be happy
